# CS305-Software-Security Portfolioo Response
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in creating financial plans encompassing savings, retirements, investments, and insurance, was our client. Our primary task was to develop a secure application for uploading and storing files which is essential for data protection and compliance with international regulations.

During the project, the static testing and manual review processes were executed effectively. Although providing more specific examples or line numbers could have improved accuracy, the overall scope and analysis were thorough. Secure coding is essential for safeguarding a company's assets and its users' data. It ensures that both data in transit and at rest are protected, preventing the exploitation or exposure of the code. This security is vital for maintaining the confidentiality of personal information and the integrity of the system's internal functionalities. 
One of the most challenging yet rewarding aspects of the project was the automated dependency check. While the manual review was straightforward due to its limited scope, setting up the dependency check presented difficulties, particularly with version mismatches that initially prevented the build from completing. However, once resolved, it could be used effortlessly throughout the rest of the project. To enhance the security layers of the application, a dependency check was conducted initially, followed by the later implementation of a self-signed certificate, HTTPS, and encryption methods. These measures significantly strengthened the application's security posture.

After refactoring the code, the application was tested for both functionality and security. This involved running the project, conducting a dependency check, and performing another manual review on the newly added sections to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. For future projects, tools like OWASP for automating dependency checks and continuous integration tools will be essential for efficiency and practicality. When showcasing this project to potential employers, I would emphasize the comprehensive approach to securing code. While automated testing played a significant role, the project also required manual review using both new and prior knowledge. Skills such as understanding APIs, manually identifying vulnerabilities, and planning security measures are crucial and are often unachievable with just automated tools. These are important skills that are essential to software security.
